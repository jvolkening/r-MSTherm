MSTherm :: Analyze MS/MS protein melting data
=======

**MSTherm** is an R package to aid in modeling and analyzing
mass-spectrometry-based protein melting data. Quantitative data is imported
and normalized and thermal behavior is modeled at the protein level. Functions
exist to simplify visualization, exploratory analysis, and analsysis of
melting temperature shifts.

Installation
------------

In Linux, do:

    git clone https://github.com/jvolkening/r-MSTherm.git
    cd r-MSTherm
    R CMD INSTALL

You will probably need to install some prerequisites first, which the
installer will tell you about.
