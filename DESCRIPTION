Description: Software to aid in modeling and analyzing mass-spectrometry-based
    protein melting data. Quantitative data is imported and normalized and
    thermal behavior is modeled at the protein level. Functions exist to
    simplify visualization, exploratory analysis, and analsysis of melting
    temperature shifts.
