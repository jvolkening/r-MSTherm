\arguments{
\item{expt}{An MSThermExperiment object}

\item{protein}{ID of the protein to model}

\item{min_rep_psm}{Minimum number of spectral matches required for each
replicate to model protein}

\item{min_smp_psm}{Minimum number of spectral matches required for each
sample to model protein}

\item{min_tot_psm}{Minimum number of spectral matches required across all
replicates to model protein}

\item{max_inf}{Maximum co-isolation interference level allowed to include a
spectrum in protein-level quantification}

\item{min_score}{minimum score allowed to include a
spectrum in protein-level quantification}

\item{max_score}{maximum score allowed to include a
spectrum in protein-level quantification}

\item{smooth}{(t/F) Perform loess smoothing on the data prior to modeling}

intervals (slow)}

\item{min_bs_psms}{Minimum number of spectral matches required to perform
bootstrapping}

\item{merge_reps}{Treat replicates as overlapping temperature series and
and merge into single series (EXPERIMENTAL!)}

\item{annot_sep}{Symbol used to separate protein group IDs (used for
retrieval of annotations) (default: '|')}

\item{max_slope}{Maximum slope to consider model (implies "only_modeled")}

\item{min_r2}{Minimum R2 value to consider model (implies "only_modeled")}

\item{min_reps}{Minimum number of modeled replicates for each sample to
return protein}

\item{only_modeled}{(t/F) Only consider modeled proteins}

quantification channels where values are expected}

\item{missing_cutoff}{Minimum fraction relative to surrounding data points
used in the check for missing channels}

\description{
Model a single protein from an MSThermExperiment object.

\details{
Valid quantification methods include:
    \describe{
       \item{"sum"}{use the sum of the spectrum values for each channel}
       \item{"median"}{use the median of the spectrum values for each
         channel}
       \item{"ratio.median"}{Like "median", but values for each spectrum
         are first converted to ratios according to "method.denom"
         channel}
       \item{"ratio.mean"}{Like "ratio.median" but using mean of ratios}
    }
Valid denominator methods include:
    \describe{
       \item{"first"}{Use the first value (lowest temperature point)
         (default)}
       \item{"max"}{Use the maximum value}
       \item{"top3"}{Use the mean of the three highest values}
       \item{"near"}{Use the median of all values greater than 80% of
         the first value}
    }
