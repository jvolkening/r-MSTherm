Changes in MSTherm 0.4.3

 o Additional additional normalization method (by Tm distribution)
 o Fixed warnings due to missing 'score' column (should be optional)
 o Fixed bug due to spectra with all missing quant values (from some quant
    software)

Changes in MSTherm 0.4.1

 o The plot.MSThermResult method has two additional arguments (CI.points and
    CI.Tm) which control whether to plot the confidence intervals if present.
    Previously these were always plotted if present. The default of both is still
    TRUE
